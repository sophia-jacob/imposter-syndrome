What the project is:
It is a website that allows individuals to be aware of imposter syndrome and express how they are feeling if dealt with similar situations.

Why I made it:
Imposter Syndrome is a real and serious condition and it is important to take action and know easy and healthy ways to cope with it.

How I made it:
I used HTML and CSS on VScode. I incorporated many pages that had interactive features, which I used CSS for.

What I struggled with/learned:
I learned how to make websites have more visually appealing features using just HTML and CSS. There were a lot of html pages in the code which made it slightly confusing to work with, but it eventually worked out.
